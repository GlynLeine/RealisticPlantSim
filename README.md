# REALISTIC PLANT SIMULATION
#### MECHATRONICA
Simulation can significantly speed up the development of new robots. Simulation can for example be used to test hardware that is physically not available yet. It can also be used to generate sensor data that can be used during development. In this project we primarily focus on generating sensor data.

Eventually, we want to test agricultural robots in simulation. The robots need to recognize plants and pull them out of the ground or harvest them. In this project we focus on the first aspect: having a realistic simulation of plants that move and look realistically. Ideally, these simulations can run in real-time with 100s of plants. In parallel, we need to explore how to combine the simulation in Unity with the robotic simulation in ROS 2 and Gazebo.

#### RESEARCH GOALS
At the end of this project we would like to see a field of crops waving in the wind. The simulation can (virtually) be observed by a camera and a lidar that is used in ROS 2. Some required functionalities for the prototype are:

 1. Model of plants that looks realistically, but can also run in real-time for a field of crops
 2. Interfacing with virtual sensors, so that the simulation in Unity can be used in a robot simulation with ROS and Gazebo.
 
Tips: For this project it is worthwile to see if you can use the NVIDIA Omniverse enviroment.

##### GUIDANCE
During the process you will be guided by experts from Saxion and Aeres hogeschool. You will work in the Saxion XR Lab in the Saxion Alphons Ariëns building (Ariënsplein).
